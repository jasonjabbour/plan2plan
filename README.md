# plan2plan

## Description

The objective of `plan2plan` is building a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model capable of generating more optimal paths that closely resemble those produced by the A* algorithm when conditioned on an obstacle map and an initial RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) path.
